# SwiLan
A simple program that translates your typed text
If you use multiple keyboard languages in your system, you must have forgotten to change the keyboard language and type text in another language. In this case, you have text that has no specific meaning.
For example, I type this text in my keyboard:
```
Hello World!
```
Oh no, I forgot to **change my keyboard language**.This is the typed text:
```
آثممخ صخقمی!
```
At this time you can call SwiLan as an **easy way :)**
